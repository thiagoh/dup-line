# DupLine

An extension for Sublime Text 2 and 3!

It allows you to duplicate lines up and down with one or multiple cursor. 

Just press the shortcut key `ctrl+alt+up` to duplicate the current line to above and `ctrl+alt+down` to duplicate it to below.

## Features

1. It extends and improves the duplicate_line sublime's plugin so you can also use `ctrl+shift+d` to duplicate the current line to below and even if you have some text selected the whole line will be copied down.
2. You can duplicate multiple lines at the same time. All you have to do is put multiple cursors with `ctrl+(mouse left click)` at each line you want to duplicate and after that `ctrl+alt+up` or `ctrl+alt+down`. 
3. You don't need to select the whole line in order to duplicate it. Any line with a selection will be duplicated.

## Install

### Package Control

The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control).

 * If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text before doing this next bit.
 * Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+P on OS X, Control+Shift+P on Linux/Windows).
 * Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
 * Type `DupLine when the list appears.

Package Control will automatically keep Git up to date with the latest version.
